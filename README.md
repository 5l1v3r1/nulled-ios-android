# Nulled Mobile App

Nulled has always been lacking something for the mobile users. The mobile UI was hard to use as it was designed with desktop in mind. Nulled Mobile App is the solution to this.

## Prerequisites

You will probably need a mac, unless you are jailbroken on your iDevice.

For Android users on the other hand you will only need your phone/tablet.

### Is This Safe?

Yes this entire thing is safe, as long as your device has no malware you will be ensured safety. I am thinking about an inbuilt VPN to keep the FBI off your back.
